# nimGame_project

These files should help you get off to a good start on the Nim programmin project! 

I recommend you *read* through nim_game_stubbed first to get an idea of how the program will be organized;
then both you and your teammates should work through "A Lesson in Exception Catching."

From there, you can divide up the programming tasks and start piecing your game together! 

Part of the challenge here is sharing code with your partners or teammates. 
Figure out a workflow that works for your team--using github or not!
